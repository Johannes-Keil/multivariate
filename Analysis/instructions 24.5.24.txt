- goal is to first show that depending on the direction (NA -> PA or PA -> NA)
  one can get different results (based on p-value)
  - lme(pa ~ na, random = ~ na | subjno, data=dat)
  - lme(na ~ pa, random = ~ pa | subjno, data=dat)
- have to draw a smaller sample to find cases with discrepancies (maybe n=10
  or n=20, but use all beeps)
- repeat this many times to create a scatterplot of the p-values for each
  study and patient group (add diagonal reference line and lines for the four
  quadrants -- sig/not sig)
- also fit the multivariate model in the sample and extract the correlation
  and the corresponding CI
- also use the 'within-person standardization approach', get the coefficient,
  which should be essentially identical to the correlation from the
  multivariate model (check with scatterplots); also can compare the CIs
  (should be very similar, but not quite identical due to difference in
  methods)
- also add random slopes to this approach and plot the correlations without
  and with random slopes against each other and plot the bounds of the CIs
  against each other
