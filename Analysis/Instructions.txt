0 = control / twins general population / low schizotypy
1 = relative of psychotic patient / psychometric risk psychosis
2 = psychotic patient / psychotic patient, not paranoid
3 = depression patient / depression in past + current mild complaints

Und hier eine Zusammenfassung der naechsten Schritte:

- using the ESM merge file data, fit NA-PA models (with random intercepts and
  slopes) in both directions within each study and subgroup; try to find a
  case where the association is significant in one but not the other direction
- optional: also do this also when separating the within- and between-subject
  relationship (but the within-subject relationship should be very similar to
  the one we get from the model where we do not separate the two)
- fit the multivariate model to get the within-person correlation and the
  corresponding CI (with intervals(res), but this may fail in some cases)
- use within-subject standardization on NA and PA

dat$zpa <- ave(dat$pa, dat$subjno, FUN = function(x) (x - mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)) / sd(x, na.rm=TRUE))
dat$zna <- ave(dat$na, dat$subjno, FUN = function(x) (x - mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)) / sd(x, na.rm=TRUE))

- fit a standard regression model (res <- lm(zpa ~ 0 + zna, data=dat))
  predicting zPA from zNA (and vice-versa, but results must be the same) to
  get the within-subject correlation (which should be more or less the same as
  that from the multivariate model); also compare the CI for the correlation
  (confint(res)) from both models (should be quite similar)
- add a random slope to the model (but no random intercept, since the variance
  should be 0 by definition due to the within-subject standardization)

res <- lme(zpa ~ 0 + zna, random = ~ 0 + zna | subjno, data=dat, na.action=na.omit)
summary(res)

- the coefficient is then like an average correlation; get the CI for the
  coefficient (intervals(res, which="fixed")) which should be wider as the
  model allows the correlation to differ across subjects
